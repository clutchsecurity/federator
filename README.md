# This initiative is part of Clutch Security's [NHI Index](https://non-human.id/)

As part of the project, we offer essential resources and practical guides on enabling inter-cloud connectivity and establishing **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** between cloud service providers (CSPs) and version control systems.

Our resources, including **Terraform files** and detailed, step-by-step tutorials, empower organizations to transition from static, long-lived NHIs to ephemeral onesâ€”drastically reducing their attack surface and strengthening their overall security posture.

## Cross Cloud Integration
This aims to configure resources in one CSP to query resources in other CSP.
